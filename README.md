# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Error: Undeclared or Mistyped Utility Class

This repository demonstrates a common error when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive.  The error arises from using an undeclared or mistyped utility class within the `@apply` directive. The error message from the build process might not directly point to the issue making debugging harder. This example showcases the problem and its solution.

**bug.css:** Contains the CSS with the typo in the `@apply` directive.
**bugSolution.css:** Contains the corrected CSS with the correct utility class.
